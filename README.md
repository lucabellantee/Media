Small and simple program in C ++ that allows you to calculate school averages, saving them in a file with date and time and allowing you to work on them: adding or deleting subjects and grades. As it was quite simple, to slightly complicate the situation, all sorting, comparisons ... were done manually without resorting to any library function. There is no graphical interface in this case, the program runs on the operating system console
